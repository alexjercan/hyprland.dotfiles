# Hyprland Config

This repository contains just the basics. For custom themes check out the
Themes section.

## Quickstart

```console
git clone https://github.com/alexjercan/hyprland.dotfiles.git
cd hyprland.dotfiles
./install
```

## Themes

The latest hyprtheme makes applying theme a bit more funky. You have to disable
one theme and after enable another.

* [Breaking Bad](https://github.com/alexjercan/breakingbad-hyprland-theme)
  custom theme inspired by the Breaking Bad show
* [Darker](https://github.com/alexjercan/darker-hyprland-theme) custom theme
  idea stolen from reddit, nice for cold weather
* [Gruvbox](https://github.com/alexjercan/gruv-hyprland-theme) just the gruvbox
  color scheme
